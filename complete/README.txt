Avante Garde — Ultra-polished static site
=======================================

How to run locally:
1. Unzip the folder.
2. Open the folder in VS Code (File → Open Folder...).
3. Right-click `index.html` and choose "Open with Live Server" (recommended) OR open the file directly in a browser.
4. The site uses GSAP for animation and a canvas-based animated gradient. The contact form is a demo placeholder.

Files included:
- index.html      (main page)
- style.css       (all styling)
- script.js       (animations & interactions)
- assets/logo.svg (placeholder logo)
- assets/favicon.svg

Notes:
- The design and animations are tuned to mimic Apple's Siri page style: layered animated gradients, glassmorphism, smooth scroll reveals and parallax.
- If you want a React/Next.js version or a minified production bundle, I can generate that next.
